        <p>Hi! I'm Rachel. As you can see, I have a great last name, so feel free to call me Moose too.
            If you're reading this I've probably asked you to hire me, or you're Googling me, because I asked you to hire me.</p>
        <p>Welcome to my website! A bit about myself first so you know what you're in for...</p>
        <p>I'm originally born and raised outside Washington D.C., but have lived in Kentucky, Southwest Virginia (Blacksburg - Go Hokies!)
            and London before moving to New York City in the summer of 2017.</p>
            <p>I'm a huge ice hockey fan, GO CAPS! I am also, much like most millenials, a huge traveler. Living in London I
                was able to visit some amazing places. Ask me about any country! I'll show you pictures later too!
                If you'd like me to...I don't want to be annoying about it.
            </p>
